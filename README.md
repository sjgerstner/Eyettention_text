# Adapting Eyettention to longer texts
## Dataset
Also clone sjgerstner/SB-SAT. This directory should be in the same directory as Eyettention_text, i.e. Eyettention_text and SB-SAT are subdirectories of the same directory.
## Training
The training code is main_sat.py.

# Eyettention: An Attention-based Dual-Sequence Model for Predicting Human Scanpaths during Reading
[![paper](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=paper&message=download%20link&color=brightgreen)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10784)

In this paper, we develop Eyettention, the first dual-sequence model that simultaneously processes the sequence of words and the chronological sequence of fixations. The alignment of the two sequences is achieved by a cross-sequence attention mechanism. We show that Eyettention outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting scanpaths. We provide an extensive within- and across-data set evaluation on different languages. An ablation study and qualitative analysis support an in-depth understanding of the model's behavior.

## Setup
